                    <p>Over the course of the past few years I've developed an interest for photography. I've really enjoyed the process of self learning the skill, but Beril made me realize how valuable a professional opinion could be for further improvement. Sometimes you need a teacher to really push you to your potential, or see photography at a different angle.</p>

                    <p>Beril had a teacher like that, a female photo journalist who's resume including spending a month on a mountain with a Kurdish army troop. To Beril, she was fearless because despite the danger she stayed on and captured moments in the camp. "She could have died up there," Beril told me. But that's a story for another time.</p>

                    <p>Back in high school Beril took a photo journalism course that forced her outside of her comfort zone. She was tasked with photographing and documenting the daily life of a family, but there were additional challenges: Beril had to find a family that was willing to be documented. Oh and she had to do this in an Italian town where they didn't speak English.</p>

                    <p>That language barrier proved to be tough to break. Beril told me how she struggled trying to find a participant for her project; she learned how to ask the family's permission in Italian, but she never understood the responses she got. Mostly people just walked away after giving her a weird look.</p>
                    
                    <p>Days went by, and Beril was ready to give up. Her teacher wasn't about to let her do it. It took more than a few phone calls, but before long her teacher had tracked her down a family. Now the actual work was about to begin. Beril lived with the family for a week, leaving the home only to sleep, then coming back the next morning to continue with the project. Tiring, but worth it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>"I was like a ghost," Beril told me. "The first few days they treated me as a guest, tried to feed me, things like that. After awhile though, they just went about their lives". Over the course of the week she melted into the surroundings, capturing the essence of small town Italian life. Beril smiled when she recalled getting shots of an argument. "I had no idea what they were saying," she said, laughing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Hearing Beril talk about it, her proudest shot of the week was a simple portrait of the father dozing off on the sofa. Compared to the photos that I've been taking of tourist attractions and scenic views, thinking about photography from a more grounded and everyday angle makes me appreciate the art a lot more. I don't need to be abroad or travelling to take interesting photos or to be proud of the photos I take. I just need to have some creativity, and put in the effort to get better.</p>
