        <div class="container">

                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>One of the things that I'm loving about being abroad is hearing insider perspectives on foreign issues. When I met Yuanyuan at a bar in Brussels I didn't think that I'd be getting into a prolonged debate about the sovereignty of Taiwan, and to be quite honest my memory of how the conversation shifted to the topic has faded into a haze of alcohol.
</p>

                    <p>What I do remember is how thoughtful, patient, and insightful Yuanyuan's arguments were, although her viewpoint was completely different from mine. As a Chinese citizen, she agreed with her government that Taiwan was simply a runaway child from the mother country. It was probably best that the rebellious streak was ended and that everyone was home for dinner (Okay, so she put it in different words, but that was her angle).</p>

                    <p>She argued that because Taiwan was previously part of China, her country had the right to take it back. although she conceded that the economic ramifications of doing so would prevent China from ever taking decisive action. When I asked her if she thought China should mobilize its armies if the economic factors weren't taken into account, she immediately said yes. Straight to the point; a far more decisive answer than I was expecting. 
</p>

                    <p>
At first I dismissed it as the alcohol talking, and who knows, maybe it was, but when I pressed her about the issue Yuanyuan maintained her stance. What about the inevitable suffering war would cause, I asked. She shrugged, and said that Taiwan had always been part of China. It was her country's duty to reclaim land that was rightfully theirs.</p>
                    
                    <p>From a western point of view, it was difficult to see things from her perspective. If I had to speculate, I'd say that Taiwan's very existence was a sign of China's weakness, and therefore a blow to national pride. I still didn't understand why she personally felt so strongly about the issue.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Why did it matter to her that Taiwan was recognized by all as a part of China? How did it affect her in any way? This was a girl that was educated abroad, seemed thoughtful and measured in her responses, and yet had, in my view, an irrational level of patriotism. </p>
                    
                    <img class= "img-responsive img-rounded" src="Images/Delirium_Bar.jpg">
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, our short encounter in an extremely crowded bar wasn't enough to truly grasp the reasoning behind her ideals. More importantly than my newfound shallow understanding is the realization that there are justifications behind opposing views. That realization is an important first step in a holistic view of any issue, and Yuanyuan reminded me of that. </p>
                    
                    <p>I'm still unconvinced that China is morally right in their stance towards Taiwan and its citizens, but after my conversation with Yuanyuan I wasn't sure that I should immediately paint China as the big bad superpower. Sure, I could take the easy route and dismiss her viewpoint as one of a "brainwashed Chinese citizen" but that would be just as ignorant as if she had dismissed me as a Canadian blindly following Western ideals.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the end, conversation shifted to lighter subjects, with both sides agreeing that the topic of Taiwan's sovereignty (or lack thereof) was a matter that couldn't be agreed upon in such a short time. I still believe that Taiwan is independent, but I am glad that Yuanyuan gave me a glimpse of the Chinese viewpoint on an extremely complex topic.</p>
